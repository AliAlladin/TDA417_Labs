Marthe Camille Bachasson, 3rd Count of Montalivet (24 April 1801, Valence – 4 January 1880, Saint-Bouize) was a French statesman and a Peer of France.


Second son of Jean-Pierre Bachasson, 1st count of Montalivet (1766–1823), peer of France and Minister of Emperor Napoleon, he was born in Valence, Drôme.
After the death of his father and brother in 1823, he inherited the title of count and peer of France, and was one of the youngest peers to sit in the Chamber of Peers.


He joined promptly the July Monarchy during the July Revolution of 1830 and was called to the Ministry of the Interior in November, where his main task was to prevent any troubles during the trial of the former ministers of King Charles X.
He was alternatively Minister of the Interior and Minister of Education in the different cabinets of the July Monarchy.
In 1832 he founded the Conférence Molé, a debating society that became a training ground for future political leaders.After 1839, he became Intendant of the Civil List, and created the Museum of Versailles in the walls of the Palace of Versailles, in order to reconcile France with the Ancien Régime.


After the 1848 Revolution, he defended the action of the July Monarchy, and, as intimate friend of the former royal family, acted as executor of the will of King Louis-Philippe.


After the fall of the Second French Empire in 1870, he rallied the "conservative republican" ideas of his friend Adolphe Thiers, and thus considerably eased the vote by the centre right of the constitutional laws of 1875, establishing a Republic in France.
He held a seat in the French Senate from 1879 to his death.


He married on 26 January 1828 Clémentine Françoise Paillard-Duclère (Laval, 21 February 1806 - Paris, 3 March 1882), and had five daughters:

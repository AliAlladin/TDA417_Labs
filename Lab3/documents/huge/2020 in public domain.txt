When a work's copyright expires, it enters the public domain. The following is a list of works that enter the public domain in 2020. Since laws vary globally, the copyright status of some works are not uniform.


With the exception of Belarus and Spain (which has a copyright term of Life + 80 years for creators that died before 1987), a work enters the public domain in Europe 70 years after the creator's death, if it was published during the creator's lifetime. The list is sorted alphabetically and includes a notable work of the creator that will enter the public domain on January 1, 2020.


In most countries of Africa and Asia, as well as Belarus, Bolivia, Canada, New Zealand and Uruguay; a work enters the public domain 50 years after the creator's death.



In 2004 copyright in Australia changed from a "plus 50" law to a "plus 70" law, in line with America and the European Union. But the change was not made retroactive (unlike the 1995 change in the European Union which brought some European authors back into copyright, especially those who died from 1925 to 1944). Hence the work of an author who died before 1955 is normally in the public domain in Australia; but the copyright of authors was extended to 70 years after death for those who died in 1955 or later, and no more Australian authors will come out of copyright until 1 January 2026 (those who died in 1955).
Unpublished works by authors who died in 1949 will enter the public domain. Any published literary, artistic, dramatic, or musical work (other than computer programs) by a not generally known author (anonymous or pseudonymous) from 1949 will enter the public domain.



In general, works published in 1924 (including printed music) enter the public domain. No United States audio recordings will enter the public domain (as those before 1972 were covered by state laws only), but audio recordings published in 1924 outside the United States enter the public domain.  Under the Music Modernization Act, United States audio recordings published in 1924 will enter the public domain in 2025.
Under the Copyright Term Extension Act, books published in 1924, films released in 1924, and other works published in 1924, will enter the public domain in 2020.Unpublished works whose authors died in 1949 will enter the public domain.
Some of the published works that will enter the public domain include the earliest sheet music for George Gershwin's Rhapsody in Blue; and the silent comedy film Sherlock Jr.

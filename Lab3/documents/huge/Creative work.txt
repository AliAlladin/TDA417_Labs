A creative work is a manifestation of creative effort including fine artwork (sculpture, paintings, drawing, sketching, performance art), dance, writing (literature), filmmaking, and musical composition.


Creative works require a creative mindset and are not typically rendered in an arbitrary fashion although some works demonstrate [have in common] a degree of arbitrariness, such that it is improbable that two people would independently create the same work. At its base, creative work involves two main stepsâ€”having an idea, and then turning that idea into a substantive form or process. The creative process can involve one or more individuals. Based upon technological advances as well as artificial intelligence there is the possibility that creative works can be created without human intervention - thereby removing the step of "having an idea". Typically the creative process has some aesthetic value which is identified as a creative expression which itself generally invokes an external stimuli which a person views as creative.
The term is frequently used in the context of copyright.

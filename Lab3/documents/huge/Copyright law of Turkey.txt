Turkish copyright law is documented in the law number 5846 on Intellectual and Artistic Works (Turkish: Fikir ve Sanat Eserleri Kanunu).
Turkey is revising its intellectual property rights laws in order to align them with WIPO standards. Turkey is a party to the Berne Convention, the Rome Convention and the TRIPS Agreement. Turkish copyright law was made compliant with these treaties after its 1995 and 2001 amendments.


The first Ottoman Empire copyright regulation was the 1850 Encumen-I Danis Nizamnamesi. The 1857 Matbaalar Nizamnamesi granted writers lifetime copyright. The 1910 Authors' Rights Act was based on mid-1800s French law or the German Copyright Code of 1901 and remained in force until 1951 though with little enforcement.


Originally written in December 1951, law 5846 has been amended by the following laws:

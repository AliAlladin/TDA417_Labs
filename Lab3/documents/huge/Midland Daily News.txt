The newspaper also prints the school newspapers for Midland High School, The Focus, and Herbert Henry Dow High School, The Update.  The Daily News was the last daily newspaper in the Tri-Cities left publishing when the Bay City Times and Saginaw News cut back their print editions to three times a week in June 2009. It still published 6 days a week, with a weekend edition.


The paper can trace its lineage to the 1858 founding of the Midland Sentinel, which after a number of ownership and name changes became the Midland Republican in 1881. In 1937, Republican publisher Philip T. Rich founded the Midland Daily News as a successor to the weekly Republican. In 1968, Rich sold the paper to Decatur, Illinois-based Lindsay-Schaub Newspapers. In 1979, Lee Enterprises purchased the Daily News along with other Lindsay-Schaub papers, then immediately resold the paper to the Hearst Corporation.

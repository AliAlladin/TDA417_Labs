The Lion The Witch & The Wardrobe is a ten-part serial adaptation of C. S. Lewis's fantasy novel The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, that aired on ITV in 1967.


The series was produced by Pamela Lonsdale and adapted for television by Trevor Preston.  Original music was provided by Paul Lewis and the programme, and the costumes, were designed by Neville Green.  The programme was made for the ITV network by ABC Television.  The animals were all portrayed by actors in costume, not unlike the later BBC adaptation.  Only two episodes, the first and eighth, are known to still survive today.

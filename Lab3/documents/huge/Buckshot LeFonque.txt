Buckshot LeFonque was a musical group project of Branford Marsalis. The name Buckshot LeFonque was a pseudonym used by jazz saxophonist Julian "Cannonball" Adderley for contractual reasons on the album Here Comes Louis Smith (1958). After playing with Sting, Miles Davis and other artists, Marsalis founded this band to create a new sound by merging classic jazz with rock, pop, R&B and hip-hop influences.


Two albums were released, Buckshot LeFonque (1994) (which featured mostly DJ Premier produced tracks) and the follow-up Music Evolution (1997) (which featured mostly Frank McComb on the vocals). Other frequent collaborators were Branford Marsalis' brother, Delfeayo Marsalis, and the rapper, Uptown.

Resource Monitor, a utility in Windows Vista and later, displays information about the use of hardware (CPU, memory, disk, and network) and software (file handles and modules) resources in real time. Users can launch Resource Monitor by executing resmon.exe (perfmon.exe in Windows Vista).
The Vista and later Resource Monitor heavily leverages the Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) facilities introduced in Windows 7;
the counter setup (event tracing session) used by the Resource Monitor can provide logging as well.


The Resource Monitor window includes five tabs:

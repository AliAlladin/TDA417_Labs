In the United States, the copyright status of works extends for the life of the author or artists, plus 70 years. If the work is owned by a corporation, then the copyright extends 95 years.Due to the passing of the Copyright Term Extension Act (Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act) in 1998, no new works will enter the public domain in this jurisdiction until 2019.In January 2012, the Supreme Court in a 6-2 decision stated that works in the public domain can have their copyright status renewed.

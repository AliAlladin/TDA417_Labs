Dub Trio is a dub/rock cross-over band from Brooklyn, New York City, New York.


Dub Trio consists of bassist Stu Brooks, guitarist DP Holmes, and drummer Joe Tomino. With the addition of electronic, rock, punk and heavy metal, the group pays homage to King Tubby's original dub style, while recreating studio trickery live on stage using various delay pedals, keyboards, and samplers.
While Tomino can add delay or loop effects to his own drums, each member of the band has the ability to "dub" the other via microphones on Tomino's kit running to delay effects on both Holmes' and Brooks' pedal boards.
In 2004, Dub Trio released the debut album, Exploring the Dangers Of. Dub Trio's first recording with vocals, "We're Not Alone"  with Mike Patton, was featured on both the group's New Heavy (2006) and on Peeping Tom's Peeping Tom (2006).

In popular music, interpolation (also called a replayed sample) refers to using a melody—or portions of a melody (often with modified lyrics)—from a previously recorded song but re-recording the melody instead of sampling it. Interpolation is often used when the artist or label who owns the piece of music declines to license the sample, or if licensing the piece of music is considered too costly.



Interpolation is prevalent in many genres of popular music; one early example is the Beatles interpolating "La Marseillaise", among four other interpolations in the song "All You Need Is Love".One genre where interpolating (as well as sampling) is highly prevalent is hip hop music; a prominent example is Stevie Wonder's "Pastime Paradise" interpolated in Coolio's hit song, "Gangsta's Paradise".

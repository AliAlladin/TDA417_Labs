Sun Newspapers is a chain of 11 weekly newspapers serving 49 different communities in Greater Cleveland. The papers are focused on suburbs and exurbs in Cuyahoga,  Geauga, Lorain and Medina counties. Its offices are in Valley View.
While some of the papers in the chain date back, under previous ownership, to the early 20th century, the company was founded in its current form in 1969, as part of SunMedia. In 1998 it was sold to Advance Publications, part of the S.I. Newhouse media empire, which also publishes The Plain Dealer, the region's major daily.

The copyright laws in Greece are part of the frame of laws which are constantly being adapted to the guidelines of the European Union.
The enforcement of the copyright laws varies from case to case. Greece has attracted attention because of its extended copyright infringement of software and music. The Greek government has tried to impose countermeasures such as the prosecution of those who produce or consume unauthorized material, with questionable results.

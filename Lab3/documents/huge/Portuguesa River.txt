Portuguesa River is a river of Venezuela. It is part of the Orinoco River basin, and is a tributary of the Apure River (which is, in turn, a tributary of the Orinoco).
Legend has it that the river's name originated from a woman originally from Portugal who drowned in its waters. In turn, the river's name is the origin of the name of the Venezuelan state of Portuguesa.

After playing college football for Richmond, he was drafted by the Philadelphia Eagles in the second round (11th overall) of the 1941 NFL Draft. His rights were transferred to the Steelers due to the events later referred to as the Pennsylvania Polka. He served in World War II for the United States Navy before rejoining the Steelers in 1945. He played for the Richmond Rebels of the Dixie League in 1946.
In 1975, Jones was inducted into the Virginia Sports Hall of Fame.

iTunes Connect is a service developed by Apple Inc. that allows digital content providers to upload and manage content (music, movies, ebooks, etc.) distributed through Apple’s online stores: iTunes Store and iBooks Store.
Earlier, iTunes Connect was also used for uploading and managing applications on the App Store and Mac App Store, but in June 2018, Apple introduced App Store Connect as a separate, though visually similar, service.Both iTunes Connect and App Store Connect let users add, edit, and remove digital items’ metadata (descriptions, keywords, screenshots, etc.), manage availability (for example, make certain items available in selected countries only), view analytics (number of downloads, revenues, and more), and collaborate on the same projects by adding team members.

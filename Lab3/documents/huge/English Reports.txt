The English Reports is a collection of nominate reports of judgments of the English Courts reported between 1220 and 1866. It contains most, but not all, of the nominate reports. It reproduces many reports not from their original editions but from dependable, although not always verbatim, later editions.
It was published in 178 volumes from 1900 to 1932 by Stevens & Sons in London and by William Green & Sons in Edinburgh. 
Under the British citation system, it is cited using the abbreviation E.R., for example:  Planché v. Colburn (1831) 131 E.R. 305. It is also sometimes cited in the American courts, where it is normally cited by using the original nominate report citation followed by Eng. Rep., for example: Planché v. Colburn, 8 Bing. 14, 131 Eng. Rep. 305 (C.P. 1831).


An index chart supplied with the reports states where each volume of the nominate reports is to be found in the English Reports. This chart is incomplete, because it indexes each of the nominate reports under a single title, though many of those reports were known by a number of titles or by a number of abbreviations of their title. A full chart is now published by Professional Books.

Dubai Festival City  (Arabic: دبي فستيفال سيتي‎) is a large residential, business and entertainment development in the city of Dubai, United Arab Emirates, owned by Al-Futtaim Group.  Touted as a "city-within-a-city", Dubai Festival City is the Middle East's largest mixed-use development: all elements for work, living, and leisure will be contained within the project. Once completed Festival City will comprise a series of residential communities, numerous hotels, malls, a golf course and other entertainment sites, and a full suite of public services, including schools.



Construction of the development, which was undertaken by Al Futtaim Carillion, began in 2003 and is expected to take 12 years. The project spans 3.8 kilometres (2.4 mi) of water frontage on the eastern bank of Dubai Creek and is 2 kilometers (1.2 mi) from Dubai International Airport. As of mid-2006, investments in the project had exceeded 11 billion AED (3 billion USD).


The development includes two hotels and a long term stay serviced apartment complex, all managed by InterContinental Hotels Group. In July 2009, Intercontinental took over management of the Al Badia Golf Course. Future developments include the 400-room Four Seasons Hotel Dubai, but construction of both hotels was put on hold in January 2009 due to the Global financial crisis of 2008–2009.


The Festival Waterfront Centre, is a retail power centre which includes IKEA, HyperPanda supermarket (first hypermarket outside of Saudi Arabia, which has now been replaced with a Carrefour supermarket) and Ace Hardware (the largest outside North America).

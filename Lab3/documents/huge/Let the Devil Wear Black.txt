Let the Devil Wear Black is a 1999 film directed by Stacy Title, co-written by Title and her husband, actor Jonathan Penner.  The film is a modern retelling of the classic play Hamlet.


The film is a modern-day version of William Shakespeare's Hamlet set in Los Angeles. Its promotional tagline is "Something is Rotten in the City of Angels".
The film reworks various Shakespearean plot devices. All of the language is modern. Comparisons are easy to spot between the play and the film if the person is familiar with the play. Even with it being based on Hamlet, Christopher Null of Film Critic said that it still has enough originality. Before the film was rated, Joe Leydon of Variety said that a couple of relatively explicit sex scenes would have to be cut if the producers wanted an R rating.


Jack, a grad student who has a history of mental illness can not get over the death of his father. Jack decides to take over his father's business. After receiving an anonymous tip that his father was murdered, he tries to put together the murder scheme. Soon after, he settles on his Uncle Carl as the prime suspect.  At the same time, he realizes that his life is in danger.




The DVD was released in 2000 in English and German. The DVD has 15 chapters, Dolby Digital 5.1 sound, pan and scan transfer, Spanish subtitles, and a moving video scene index menu. The special features are behind the scenes footage and two versions of the film's movie trailer.


A Reel Film review said the actors are good and that the somber tone makes the film watchable. Christopher Null, of Film Critic, said that the film's most priceless moment is when the character Ophelia samples dog food.

The 1998 NFL draft was the procedure by which National Football League teams selected amateur college football players. It is officially known as the NFL Annual Player Selection Meeting. The draft was held April 18â€“19, 1998, at the Theater at Madison Square Garden in New York City, New York. The league also held a supplemental draft after the regular draft and before the regular season.
Before the draft, there was much debate in the media on if the Indianapolis Colts would select Peyton Manning or Ryan Leaf, both of whom were considered excellent prospects and future franchise quarterbacks, with the first overall pick. Leaf was considered to have more upside and a stronger throwing arm, while Manning was considered a prospect who was NFL ready and more mature.
On the day of the draft, the Colts selected Manning due to Leaf's disdain for Indianapolis. Manning went on to be a five-time Most Valuable Player award winner, the most of any player in NFL history, and a two-time Super Bowl champion, whereas Leaf was out of the NFL by 2002, and is considered one of the biggest draft busts in NFL history.




A supplemental draft was held in the summer of 1998. For each player selected in the supplemental draft, the team forfeits its pick in that round in the draft of the following season. The Green Bay Packers and San Diego Chargers both selected players in the 2nd round.




As of 2018, Randy Moss is the only player from the 1998 NFL Draft to have been inducted into the Professional Football Hall of Fame. Peyton Manning and Charles Woodson are considered likely future Hall of Famers.

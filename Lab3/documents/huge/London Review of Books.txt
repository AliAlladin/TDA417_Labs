The London Review of Books (LRB) is a British journal of literary essays. It is  published twice a month.


The LRB was founded in 1979, when publication of The Times Literary Supplement was suspended during the year-long lock-out at The Times.Its founding editors were Karl Miller, then professor of English at University College London, Mary-Kay Wilmers, formerly an editor at The Times Literary Supplement, and Susannah Clapp, a former editor at Jonathan Cape. For its first six months, it appeared as an insert in The New York Review of Books. In May 1980, the London Review became an independent publication with an orientation described by Alan Bennett, a prominent contributor throughout the LRB's history, as "consistently radical".Unlike The Times Literary Supplement (TLS), the majority of the articles the LRB publishes (usually fifteen per issue) are long essays. Some articles in each issue are not based on books, while several short articles discuss film or exhibitions. Political and social essays are frequent. The magazine is headquartered in Bloomsbury, London.Mary-Kay Wilmers took over as editor in 1992. Average circulation per issue for 2018 was 75,725.In January 2010, The Times claimed that the London Review of Books was Â£27m in debt to the Wilmers' family trust, although the trust had "no intention of the lender seeking repayment of the loan in the near future".In 2011, when Pankaj Mishra criticised Niall Ferguson's book Civilisation: The West and the Rest in the London Review of Books, Ferguson threatened to sue for libel.The London Review Bookshop opened in Bloomsbury in May 2003, and the Cake Shop next door in November 2007. The bookshop is used as a venue for author presentations and discussions.

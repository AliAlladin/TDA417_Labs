The name Anantnag is thought to originate from the Sanskrit term ananta, meaning "infinite", and Kashmiri word naga, "water spring"; Anantnag would thus mean "numerous springs", as there are indeed many springs in the town. According to Marc Aurel Stein, however, the name of the city comes from the name of the spring of Shesha Nag, the "Divine Serpent" in Hindu theology, who was also called Anantnag; the spring located in the town. This is also corroborated by almost all local historians including Kalhana, according to whom the city has taken the name of the spring of Shesha Nag also known as Ananta Nag.The name Islamabad is believed to have derived from the name of a Mughal governor Islam Khan who built a garden in the area.Both names are used for the town, Anantnag being preferred by the Hindus and Sikhs and Islamabad being preferred by the Muslims. The district surrounding the town was called the Islamabad district until the 1950s when Bakshi Ghulam Mohammad administration changed it to "Anantnag district". The locals continue to use the name "Islamabad", even though the Indian security forces deployed in the area with the start of Kashmir insurgency frowned on its use.

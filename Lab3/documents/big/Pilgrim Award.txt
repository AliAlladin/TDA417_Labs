The Pilgrim Award is presented by the Science Fiction Research Association for Lifetime Achievement in the field of science fiction scholarship.  It was created in 1970 and was named after J. O. Baileyâ€™s pioneering book Pilgrims Through Space and Time.  Fittingly, the first award was presented to Bailey.

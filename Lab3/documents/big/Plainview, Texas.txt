Customers in the city are also served by the Lubbock Avalanche-Journal, which often reports on news from Plainview.
Eight radio stations broadcast from the city, including KVOP, among the oldest in the region. KVOP's call sign originally meant "Voice of Plainview".The city is within the Lubbock television market. Due to the terrain, television stations based in Amarillo can be received over-the-air, either directly or via repeaters north of the city.

After changes were made to must-carry rules by the Federal Communications Commission only stations from Lubbock are available to cable and digital satellite customers in the city.
The Steve Martin film Leap of Faith (1992) was filmed in and around Plainview. Several residents were hired as extras for the film. Until 2016, a water tower east of downtown bore the name and mascot of the fictional town on which the movie was set: Rustwater Bengals.
An episode of Vice falsely portrayed the city as a ghost town in a documentary feature called "Deliver Us from Drought", despite 22,000 residents still living in the city at the time of filming. The documentary featured numerous locations, many of which had been closed or abandoned for years prior, as examples of recent rural flight following a drought. The documentary followed the template of a similar short, "Dry and Drier in West Texas", which was broadcast on Showtime. Both documentaries portrayed residents of the city as excessively religious.

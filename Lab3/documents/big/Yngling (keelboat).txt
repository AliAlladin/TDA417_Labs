An Yngling  (; Norwegian: [ˈʏŋlɪŋ]) is a sailing boat which the International Yngling Association call an "agreeable cross between a planing dinghy and a keelboat." It can be regarded as a smaller version of the Soling although there are differences in sailing characteristics, proportion, and tuning requirements, between the two classes.
It was designed in 1967 by Jan Herman Linge to build a keelboat for his young son, and thus named it Yngling, the Norwegian word for "youngster"; the name is unrelated to the House of Yngling or the Ynglinga saga.
In the last quarter of the last century the class gained interest in many countries worldwide and spread over the continents of North America, Australia and Europe.The Yngling received ISAF International Class status in 1979 and was chosen as the Olympic Women's Keelboat for 2004 and 2008. The boat's Olympic status led to a flurry of activity in building and sail design refinements. For the London 2012 Summer Olympics the Yngling was replaced by the Elliott 6m.
More than 4,000 Ynglings have been built and they are actively raced in 3 continents.
Since 2010 the Yngling is one of the Vintage Yachting Classes of the Vintage Yachting Games.

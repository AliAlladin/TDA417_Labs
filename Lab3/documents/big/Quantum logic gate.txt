In quantum computing and specifically the quantum circuit model of computation, a quantum logic gate (or simply quantum gate) is a basic quantum circuit operating on a small number of qubits. They are the building blocks of quantum circuits, like classical logic gates are for conventional digital circuits.
Unlike many classical logic gates, quantum logic gates are reversible. However, it is possible to perform classical computing using only reversible gates. For example, the reversible Toffoli gate can implement all Boolean functions, often at the cost of having to use ancilla bits. The Toffoli gate has a direct quantum equivalent, showing that quantum circuits can perform all operations performed by classical circuits.


Quantum logic gates are represented by unitary matrices. The number of qubits in the input and output of the gate must be equal; a gate which acts on 
  
    
      
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle n}
   qubits is represented by a 
  
    
      
        
          2
          
            n
          
        
        ×
        
          2
          
            n
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle 2^{n}\times 2^{n}}
   unitary matrix. The quantum states that the gates act upon are vectors in 
  
    
      
        
          2
          
            n
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle 2^{n}}
   complex dimensions. The base vectors are the possible outcomes if measured, and a quantum state is a linear combination of these outcomes. The most common quantum gates operate on spaces of one or two qubits, just like the common classical logic gates operate on one or two bits.
The vector representation of a single qubit is:

  ) gate
The Pauli-Z gate acts on a single qubit. It equates to a rotation around the Z-axis of the Bloch sphere by 
  
    
      
        π
      
    
    {\displaystyle \pi }
   radians. Thus, it is a special case of a phase shift gate (which are described in a next subsection) with 
  
    
      
        ϕ
        =
        π
      
    
    {\displaystyle \phi =\pi }
  . It leaves the basis state 
  
    
      
        
          |
        
        0
        ⟩
      
    
    {\displaystyle |0\rangle }
   unchanged and maps 
  
    
      
        
          |

        −
        
          |
        
        1
        ⟩
      
    
    {\displaystyle -|1\rangle }
  . Due to this nature, it is sometimes called phase-flip. It is represented by the Pauli Z matrix:

  
    
      
        Z
        =
        
          
            [

            ]
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle Z={\begin{bmatrix}1&0\\0&-1\end{bmatrix}}}
  .

Squared root-gates can be constructed for all other gates by finding a unitary matrix that, multiplied by itself, yields the gate one wishes to construct the squared root gate of. All rational exponents of all gates can be found similarly.

When U is one of the Pauli matrices, σx, σy, or σz, the respective terms "controlled-X", "controlled-Y", or "controlled-Z" are sometimes used. Sometimes this is shortened to just cX, cY and cZ.

    {\displaystyle D(\pi /2)}
   gate; is a 3-bit gate, which is universal for classical computation but not for quantum computation. The quantum Toffoli gate is the same gate, defined for 3 qubits. If we limit ourselves to only accepting input qubits that are

   it applies a Pauli-X (or NOT) on the third bit, else it does nothing. It is an example of a controlled gate. Since it is the quantum analog of a classical gate, it is completely specified by its truth table. The Toffoli gate is universal when combined with the single qubit Hadamard gate.
It can be also described as the gate which maps

The Fredkin gate (also CSWAP or cS gate), named after Edward Fredkin, is a 3-bit gate that performs a controlled swap. It is universal for classical computation. It has the useful property that the numbers of 0s and 1s are conserved throughout, which in the billiard ball model means the same number of balls are output as input.

  Unfortunately, a working Deutsch gate has remained out of reach, due to lack of a protocol. However, a method was proposed to realize such a Deutsch gate with dipole-dipole interaction in neutral atoms.



Informally, a set of universal quantum gates is any set of gates to which any operation possible on a quantum computer can be reduced, that is, any other unitary operation can be expressed as a finite sequence of gates from the set. Technically, this is impossible with anything less than an uncountable set of gates since the number of possible quantum gates is uncountable, whereas the number of finite sequences from a finite set is countable. To solve this problem, we only require that any quantum operation can be approximated by a sequence of gates from this finite set. Moreover, for unitaries on a constant number of qubits, the Solovay–Kitaev theorem guarantees that this can be done efficiently.
One simple set of two-qubit universal quantum gates is the Hadamard gate

  The universal classical logic gate, the Toffoli gate, is reducible to the Deutsch gate, 
  
    
      
        D
        (
        
          
            
              
                
                  
                    π

        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle D({\begin{matrix}{\frac {\pi }{2}}\end{matrix}})}
  , thus showing that all classical logic operations can be performed on a universal quantum computer.
There also exists a single two-qubit gate sufficient for universality, given it can be applied to any pairs of qubits 
  
    
      
        (
        k
        ,
        k
        +
        1
        )
        
        mod
        
        
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle (k,k+1)\mod n}
   on a circuit of width 
  
    
      
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle n}
  .Another set of universal quantum gates consists of the Ising gate and the phase-shift gate.  These are the set of gates natively available in some trapped-ion quantum computers.



Measurement (sometimes called observation) is irreversible and therefore not a quantum gate, because it assigns the observed variable to a single value. Measurement takes a quantum state and projects it to one of the base vectors, with a likelihood equal to the square of the vectors depth along that base vector. This is a stochastic non-reversible operation as it sets the quantum state equal to the base vector that represents the measured state (the state "collapses" to a definite single value). Why and how, or even if this is so, is called the measurement problem.

        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle n}
   classical bits would. Unlike classical computers, quantum states can have a probability amplitude in multiple measurable values simultaneously. This is called superposition.



If two different quantum registers are entangled (their combined state cannot be expressed as a tensor product), measurement of one register affects or reveals the state of the other register by partially or entirely collapsing its state too. This effect can be used for computation, and is used in many algorithms.
The first of the Bell states is

because for example

    {\displaystyle ac}
   and

  .
The quantum state span the two qubits. This is called entanglement. The GHZ state is a similiar entangled quantum state that span three qubits. Measuring one of the two qubits that make up this Bell state will result in that the other qubit logically must have the same value, both must be the same. 
This type of value-assignment in theory occurs instantaneously over any distance and this has as of 2018 been experimentally verified for distances of up to 1200 kilometers. That the phenomena appears to violate the speed of light is called the EPR paradox and it is an open question in physics how to resolve this. Originally it was solved by giving up the assumption of local realism, but other interpretations have also emerged. For more information see the Bell test experiments. This can not be used for faster-than-light communication of classical information, because of the no-communication theorem.

  . If we now measure the qubits in register A, then register B will be found to contain the same value as A. If we however instead apply a quantum logic gate that implements a function 
  
    
      
        F
      
    
    {\displaystyle F}
   on A and then measure it, then register B will contain a value such that

   is the unitary inverse of 
  
    
      
        F

Because of how unitary inverses of gates act, 
  
    
      
        
          F

        =

  . For example, say 
  
    
      
        F
        (
        x
        )
        =

          )
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle F(x)=x+3{\pmod {2^{n}-1}}}
  , then 
  
    
      
        B
        =
        A
        −
        3

          )
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle B=A-3{\pmod {2^{n}-1}}}
  . 
The order in which measurement is performed (on the registers A or B) can be reversed, or even concurrently interleaved qubit by qubit, without affecting the result, since the measurements assignment of one register will limit the possible value-space from the other entangled register.
This effect of value-assignment via entanglement is used in Shor's algorithm.




Assume that we have two gates A and B, that both act on 
  
    
      
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle n}
   qubits. When B is put after A (a series circuit), then the effect of the two gates can be described as a single gate C.

  
    
      
        C
        =
        B
        ⋅
        A
      
    
    {\displaystyle C=B\cdot A}
  
Where 
  
    
      
        ⋅
      
    
    {\displaystyle \cdot }
   is the usual matrix multiplication. The resulting gate C will have the same dimensions as A and B. The order in which the gates would appear in a circuit diagram is reversed when multiplying them together.
For example, putting the Pauli X gate after the Pauli Y gate, both of which act on a single qubit, can be described as a single combined gate C:

  
    
      
        C
        =
        X
        ⋅
        Y

If two or more qubits are viewed as a single quantum state, this combined state is equal to the tensor product of the constituent qubits. Any state that can be written as a tensor product from the constituent subsystems are called separable states. On the other hand, an entangled state is any state that cannot be tensor-factorized, or in other words: An entangled state can not be written as a tensor product of its constituent qubits states. Special care must be taken when applying gates to constituent qubits that make up entangled states.
If we have a set of N qubits that are entangled and wish to apply a quantum gate on M < N qubits in the set, we will have to extend the gate to take N qubits. This can be done by combining the gate with an identity matrix such that their tensor product becomes a gate that act on N qubits. The identity matrix (
  
    
      
        I
      
    
    {\displaystyle I}
  ) is a representation of the gate that maps every state to itself (i.e., does nothing at all). In a circuit diagram the identity gate or matrix will appear as just a wire.
For example, the Hadamard gate (
  
    
      
        H
      
    
    {\displaystyle H}
  ) acts on a single qubit, but if we for example feed it the first of the two qubits that constitute the entangled Bell state

    {\displaystyle {\frac {|00\rangle +|11\rangle }{\sqrt {2}}}}
  , we cannot write that operation easily. We need to extend the Hadamard gate 
  
    
      
        H
      
    
    {\displaystyle H}
   with the identity gate 
  
    
      
        I
      
    
    {\displaystyle I}

        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle n}
   is the number of qubits the gates act on, it is believed to be intractable to simulate large quantum systems using classical computers.


Because all quantum logical gates are reversible, any composition of multiple gates is also reversible. All products and tensor products of unitary matrices are also unitary matrices. This means that it is possible to construct an inverse of all algorithms and functions, as long as they do not contain any initialization or measurement. (Initialization, measurement and uncontrolled decoherence are the only phenomena that result in side effects in quantum computers. Gates are purely functional and bijective.)

For example, an algorithm for addition can in some situations be used for substraction, if it is being "run in reverse". The inverse quantum fourier transform is the unitary inverse. Unitary inverses can also be used for uncomputation. Programming languages for quantum computers, such as Microsofts Q# and Bernhard Ömer's QCL, contain circuit inversion as programming concepts.


The current notation for quantum gates was developed by Barenco et al., building on notation introduced by Feynman.

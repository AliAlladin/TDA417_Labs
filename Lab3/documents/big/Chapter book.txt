A chapter book or chapterbook is a story book intended for intermediate readers, generally age 7â€“10.  Unlike picture books for beginning readers, a chapter book tells the story primarily through prose, rather than pictures.  Unlike books for advanced readers, chapter books contain plentiful illustrations.  The name refers to the fact that the stories are usually divided into short chapters, which provide readers with opportunities to stop and resume reading if their attention spans are not long enough to finish the book in one sitting.  Chapter books are usually works of fiction of moderate length and complexity.
Examples of "chapter books" include:

Flat Stanley  (1964) by Jeff Brown
Busybody Nora (1976) by Johanna HurwitzThe New York Times Best Seller list of Children's Chapter Books has included books with intended audience age ranges from 6 to 12 and up.  This may reflect a straightforward interpretation of "chapter books" as those books directed at children that are long enough to include chapters.  However, some publishers such as Scholastic Corporation and Harper Collins include the phrase "chapter book" in series titles aimed specifically at younger or beginning readers, including the I Can Read! series and the Magic School Bus series.

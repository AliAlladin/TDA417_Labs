On February 8, 2005, the Division of Licensing, Medical Board of California reviewed, and determined that St. Matthew's University graduates are ineligible for licensure. This was due to attrition rates above 80%, low USMLE pass rate, and unorganized clinical rotations in remote locations.
In the United States, the medical boards of the following states have banned St. Matthew's University graduates from obtaining licensure::

California
Indiana
Kansas
North DakotaA future approval would still bar physicians from obtaining a licensure, unless if they start basic sciences after the approval date.
In the United Kingdom, the General Medical Council has listed St. Matthew's University as an institution whose graduates from the Belize campus are ineligible for licensure. Graduates from the current Cayman Islands campus are eligible for licensure.


The residence hall is an old Sleep hotel. The rent for a small room is $4245–4800 for almost 4 months. The high speed internet provided is 3.25 Mbps.

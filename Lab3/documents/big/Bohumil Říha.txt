Bohumil Říha (22 February 1907 – 15 December 1987) was a Czech writer best known for children's books. For his lasting contribution to children's literature he received the Hans Christian Andersen Medal in 1980.


One of his most noted works is Children's Encyclopaedia (1959) that has since its publication enjoyed almost a cult following – its structure offers, besides information for beginning readers, more detailed information for children who wish to learn more about any of the subjects.
Other works include The River (1962, co-authored by Karel Friedrich), The Great Picture Book for Children (1976), The Great Animal Picture Book (1981; both together with Milena Lukešová), and Merry Tales – And What Else? (1964).
He died in Prague.
The biennial Hans Christian Andersen Award conferred by the International Board on Books for Young People is the highest recognition available to a writer or illustrator of children's books. Jansson received the writing award in 1966.

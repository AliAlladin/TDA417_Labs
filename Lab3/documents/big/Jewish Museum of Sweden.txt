The Jewish Museum (in Swedish: Judiska Museet) in Stockholm, Sweden, is devoted to objects and environments related to Jewish religion, tradition, and history, particularly in connection to Judaism in Sweden. The museum opened in 1987 in Frihamnen and moved in 1992 to a building designed by Ragnar Östberg built in the years 1929–1931 as a girls' school. In 2016 the museum moved once again, to new premises at Själagårdsgatan 19 in the Old Town in Stockholm, at the location of an 18th Century synagogue.
The Jewish Museum was founded by Viola and Aaron Neuman and was inaugurated in 1987 by the Minister of Culture Bengt Goransson. In 1994, the museum became the first recipient of the Swedish Museum Association prize Museum of the Year.

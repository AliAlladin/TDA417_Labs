The Treasure Truck is a service offered to users of the Amazon.com app, which offers users a discounted daily deal. The service consists of a fleet of 33 vehicles in 30 major cities located in the United States and United Kingdom. The first Treasure Truck was released in Amazon's hometown of Seattle in June 2015. The trucks offer one item that changes daily which customers order using the Amazon app and come to a designated pick-up spot. As part of a holiday promotion, Seattle Seahawks player Marshawn Lynch drove the Treasure Truck around Seattle in December 2016 selling a limited-edition beast-mode Echo. In December 2017, two cities in the United Kingdom became the first international locations for the Treasure Truck program. The art on each of the trucks is unique and hand-drawn by Kyler Martz. Each Treasure Truck is active 3 to 4 days per month.

A boy named Nono, living on the countryside, is making a living by selling vegetables in the city nearby. One day two strangers approach him to offer him a gem which looks a flower seed for his produce. He accepts the trade and at home he plants the seed inside a small pot. Soon a tiny planet emerges, so he continues to tend after the planet and a few days later three moons are circling around the tiny planet. Once again Nono had to leave the countryside to sells his produce and again meets the two strangers who have a final request for him.

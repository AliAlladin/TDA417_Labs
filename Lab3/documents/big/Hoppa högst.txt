The film is about two rival boys, Albin (Markus Åström) and Stig (Ramses Ericstam), whose mothers (Lena T. Hansson and Suzanne Reuter, respectively) have them compete against each other throughout their childhood. The rival mothers compete in whose child will learn to walk and talk first. As the boys grow older and start school, they begin to compete by themselves. Competitions include seeing who dares to jump to the ground from various high places, including a tree, a bridge, and a hayloft. They also have an earthworm-eating contest. One day, as they compete for who dares to jump from the roof of a barn, both boys break a leg and end up at the hospital. As they begin to recover, the boys laugh with each other, realizing how stupid their rivalry has been.

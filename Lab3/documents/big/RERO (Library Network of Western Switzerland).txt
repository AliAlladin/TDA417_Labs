The Library Network of Western Switzerland (French: Réseau des bibliothèques de Suisse occidentale; RERO) was founded by several major libraries in 1985, in the French-speaking region of Romandy in western Switzerland. RERO is a portmanteau of "Réseau Romand" ("Romand Network").
RERO includes most of the cantonal, academic, public, and specialized libraries in Switzerland. It manages a union catalog of 180 libraries serving 50,000 students from three academic universities; Geneva, Fribourg, and Neuchâtel; the University of Applied Sciences and Arts; and the Universities of Teacher Education.
As of 2019, the RERO catalog provides access to some 6.8 million bibliographic descriptions for more than 10 million documents. The catalog also describes 222,400 periodicals, including 3,169 electronic journals. In addition to its catalog, RERO supports an interlibrary loan system, its own indexing system, a digital library based on the principle of free access, and a federated search system.

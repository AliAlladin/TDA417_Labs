Stig Olin, né Högberg (11 September 1920 – 28 June 2008) was a Swedish actor, theatre director, songwriter and singer. 
He was the father of actress Lena Olin and singer Mats Olin. He was married to  film actresses Britta Holmberg  and Helena Kallenbäck.




Olin had a successful acting career, appearing in lead roles in a number of early Ingmar Bergman films, including Torment/Frenzy (Swedish: Hets) (1944; Bergman's script debut), Crisis (1946), Kvinna utan ansikte (Woman Without a Face) (1947; script by Bergman), Port of Call (1948), Eva (1948; script by Bergman), Prison (1949), To Joy (1950), Summer Interlude (1951) and Divorced (1951; script by Bergman).
Successful film roles also included a love struck student in the Sickan Carlsson film Klasskamrater (1952), Ernst in his own popular children's film Rasmus, Pontus och Toker (1956) and the scrubby old Potato-Algot in Jim och piraterna Blom (1987), directed by Hans Alfredson (from Hasse & Tage).


Olin then moved on to directing for both film and stage in the 1950s, 60s and 70s, focusing on comedies and musicals (including the original Swedish staging of Stephen Sondheim's A Little Night Music in 1978). In 1970 he became Director of Programmes at Swedish Radio, including the Swedish radio theatre, where he also directed a number of plays.


He was also a songwriter with En gång jag seglar i hamn, På söndag, Människors glädje, Jag tror på sommaren and Karusellvisan, a.o.

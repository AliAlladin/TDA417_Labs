The National Foundation for Australian Women (NFAW) was set up by a group of women's rights campaigners who wished to establish a body to promote women's movement ideas and policies. It was established in 1989 with seed money of $100,000 from Pamela Denoon and a trust fund in her name. It was to be independent of political parties and was to form partnerships with other women's organisations. Its purpose was to ensure that women's history, knowledge, and wisdom would be accessible to new generations of women, and to advance and protect Australian women's interest in all spheres of life.

Expressen ("The Express") is one of two nationwide evening newspapers in Sweden, the other being Aftonbladet. Expressen was founded in 1944; its symbol is a wasp and its slogans are "it stings" or "Expressen to your rescue".


The first edition of Expressen was published on 16 November 1944. A main feature that day was an interview with the crew members of a British bomber who were successful in sinking the German ship Tirpitz. A project of Albert Bonnier Jr., Carl-Adam Nycop, and Ivar Harrie – who was to become the first editor-in-chief – Expressen was created in part to push back against "national socialism and related violent ideologies."The paper is owned by the Bonnier Group. As of 2005, the paper had a liberal stance, but it declared its independent leaning in 1995.Through mergers, the Gothenburg edition of Expressen is titled GT (originally Göteborgs-Tidningen) and the Malmö edition is titled Kvällsposten, but the three share half of the content. Expressen (with GT and Kvällsposten) maintains a centre-right political profile, describing its editorial position as "independent liberal", while the competitor Aftonbladet is social-democratic. Ownership of Expressen (and Sweden's largest morning newspaper Dagens Nyheter) is controlled by the Bonnier family, while Aftonbladet is owned jointly by Swedish trade unions and the Norwegian publishing family Schibsted.

In 1998, Bonnier AB bought the newspaper and since then it has become a regional edition of Expressen – distributed in the southwest of Sweden, including Västra Götaland County.

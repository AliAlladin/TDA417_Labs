In late 2010s, TVP has been criticized for becoming unduly biased towards the ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party. In 2018, The Economist noted: "the [TVP] anchors... praise PiS slavishly while branding its critics treacherous crypto-communists.


TVP has an agreement with the BBC, under which they will work together on film and television productions.The French-German TV liberal arts network ARTE cancelled a 15-year cooperation with TVP, when it learned in February 2009 that TVP's general director, Piotr Farfał, was a member of the League of Polish Families, which opposed Arte’s "philosophy based on intercultural exchange" and "the party that TVP's chairman is presently connected with does not share European values". It was again cancelled in January 2016 after an amendment of the media law in Poland, which caused fears of a lack of pluralism and independence of TVP.

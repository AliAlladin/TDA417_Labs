Many Antarctic research stations support satellite field camps which are, in general, seasonal camps. The type of field camp can vary â€“ some are permanent structures used during the annual Antarctic summer, whereas others are little more than tents used to support short term activities. Field camps are used for many things, from logistics (Sky Blu) to dedicated scientific research (WAIS Divide Field Camp).

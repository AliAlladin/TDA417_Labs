From 1959 to 1974, she was half of the popular folk duo Ian & Sylvia with Ian Tyson.  The two met after a friend of Tyson's heard her sing at a party and let Ian know about her; Tyson had been performing in Toronto clubs as a solo artist, but after he and Fricker met, they decided to work together as a duo.  Their full-time collaboration began in 1961 and would continue for a decade. From the late 1960s to the early 1970s, she and Ian Tyson also fronted the country rock band Great Speckled Bird.

She then established an independent record label, Salt Records, in 1978. Through this label she released the albums, Satin on Stone in 1978 and Sugar for Sugar in 1979.Sylvia Tyson contributed offstage to the Canadian music scene as a board member of FACTOR and the Juno Awards.

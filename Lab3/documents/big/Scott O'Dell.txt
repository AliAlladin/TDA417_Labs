Scott O'Dell was born O'Dell Gabriel Scott, but after his name was incorrectly published on a book as"Scott O'Dell", he decided to keep the name. He was born on Terminal Island in Los Angeles, California, to parents May Elizabeth Gabriel and Bennett Mason Scott. He attended multiple colleges, including Occidental College in 1919, the University of Wisconsin–Madison in 1920, Stanford University in -1921, and the Sapienza University of Rome in 1925. During World War II, he served in the United States Army Air Forces. Before becoming a full-time writer, he was employed as a cameraman and technical director, as a book columnist for the Los Angeles Mirror, and as book review editor for the Los Angeles Daily News. He was married two times. His wives were Jane Dorsa Rattenbury, and Elizabeth Hall.
In 1934, O'Dell began writing articles as well as fiction and nonfiction books for adults. In the late 1950s, he began writing children's books.  His first children's book was Island of the Blue Dolphins.
In 1984, he established the Scott O'Dell Award for Historical Fiction, an award for $5,000 that recognizes outstanding works of historical fiction.  The winners must be published in English by a U.S. publisher and be set in the New World (North, Central, and South America).  In 1986, The Bulletin of the Center for Children's Books awarded O'Dell this same award.Scott O'Dell died of prostate cancer on October 15, 1989 at the age of 91.


There have been several film adaptations of O'Dell's work.  Island of the Blue Dolphins has been translated into a number of languages and was made into a movie in 1964, starring Celia Kaye, Larry Domasin, Ann Daniel, and George Kennedy. In 1978, Saul Swimmer produced and directed a film version of The Black Pearl with Gilbert Roland and Mario Custodio. The King's Fifth was adapted into the 1982 anime television series The Mysterious Cities of Gold, a Japan-France co-production that was aired in several different countries.

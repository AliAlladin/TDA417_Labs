Pippi in the South Seas is a 1948 sequel to Astrid Lindgren's classic children's books, Pippi Longstocking and Pippi Goes on Board. It is set sometime after the events of the original book and centers around Pippi's further misadventures and experiences, and the main protagonist's theory that the reason for her father's mysterious disappearance that he was hailed as king of an island of natives is confirmed as true.


In this book, a few of Pippi's newer experiences include her warding off a snobbish, portly tourist who believes Villa Villekulla, her home, to be for sale and dismisses her as ugly and ridiculous; inadvertently mouthing off to a teacher from Tommy and Annika Settergren's school during an examination of pupils; and entertaining Tommy and Annika while they are sick with measles. She also soon receives word from her father, a sea captain who had seemingly vanished earlier, inviting her to a tropical island inhabited by natives over which he now reigns as king. Pippi and her friends sail to her father's island kingdom, where they become acquainted with the natives living there, Pippi being hailed as "Princess Pippilotta."


The book was adapated into a 1970 film of the same name. In it, Pippi requestshelp from her friends Annika and Tommy as she ventures out onto the Sea to rescue her father who was captured by pirates. This came originally from a Swedish title PIPPI LÅNGSTRUMP PÅ DE SJU HAVEN [motion picture] alternate title: PIPPI IN TAKA-TUKA-LAND. Pippi Longstocking was played by Inger Nilsson, Annika played by Maria Persson and directed by Olle Hellbom.
